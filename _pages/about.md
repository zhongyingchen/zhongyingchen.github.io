I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/) at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm), Nanjing, China.



I received a B.E. degree in energy engineering from [Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2017 and an M.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/)  in 2018. <br>
I was a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering at HKUST during 2018--2020. I went to [City University of Hong Kong (CityU)](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) in 2020  and received a Ph.D degree in Computer Science from CityU in 2023, where I was so fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jun Wang](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/jun-wang(6d556e00-9da5-4b40-9602-8ee68ce4e526).html) (Member of Academia Europaea, IEEE Life Fellow, IAPR Fellow, Dean of the School of Data Science). I joined [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm) in 2024.


My research interests include optimization methods, neural networks, computational intelligence, and smart energy systems.
