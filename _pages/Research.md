 My Ph.D. research at CityU focuses on developing **collaborative neurodynamic optimization (CNO)** approaches to efficiently operate the systems in **smart grids**.  The systems of interest include **power generation systems** and **building energy systems**, as highlighted in the above figure. 
 
 
I work with [Prof. Jun Wang](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/jun-wang(6d556e00-9da5-4b40-9602-8ee68ce4e526).html) (advisor) and [Prof. Qing-Long Han](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=j0pyptAAAAAJ&hl=en) to develop some CNO-driven algorithms for addressing the following three issues:
